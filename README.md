## 🧠 Overview

The **Spark Self-Tuning Framework** provides continuous and adaptive optimization of Apache Spark configurations by combining:

- **Bayesian Optimization (BO)** with a custom acquisition function (`LCB`)
- **Compositional surrogate models** for performance and uncertainty estimation
- **Iterated Local Search + Tabu Search (ILS–TS)** for guided exploration and local refinement
- **Safe Transfer Learning (STL-PARN)** to reuse historical workload executions
- **Baseline implementations**: *Garralda*, *TurBO*, *YORO*, and *Naïve BO*

This framework enables cost-aware, knowledge-driven configuration tuning for complex Spark workloads.
